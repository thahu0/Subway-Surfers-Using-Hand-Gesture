# 🕹️ Gesture Controlled Subway Surfers (Touchless Gaming)

**Control Subway Surfers using just hand gestures!**  
Built using **Python**, **MediaPipe**, and **OpenCV**, this project turns your webcam into a real-time controller — no keyboard, no mouse!

## 🎮 How It Works

Your webcam captures hand gestures, and the program maps them to in-game actions using gesture recognition.

### 🖐️ Gesture Controls

| Gesture                  | Action        |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| 👉 Index Finger           | Move Right    |
| ✌️ Index + Middle Fingers | Move Left     |
| ✋ Open Palm              | Jump          |
| ✊ Fist                   | Slide         |
